**                TDeinterlace for AviSynth 2.6 interface
**
**   TDeinterlace is a bi-directionally motion adaptive deinterlacer.
**   It also uses a couple modified forms of ela interpolation which
**   help to reduce "jaggy" edges in places where interpolation must
**   be used. TDeinterlace currently supports 8 bit planar YUV and YUY2 colorspaces.
